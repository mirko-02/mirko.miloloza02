    <p>  Of all the trips I've been on, one has made a particularly strong impression. Like any kid who plays football from a young age, everything that has to do with the sport is more than fascinating.
 When my parents told me we would use the holidays this spring to travel to<strong> <em> Barcelona </em></strong>, the only thing that was in my mind was the famous <strong> Nou Kamp </strong> Stadium. Seems like I was just getting ready for something like that, all I packed in my bag was sportswear. I have heard before that there are tourist tours that involve visiting even the locker rooms themselves. I was ready, the apparatus, the sports equipment and all my savings that I needed to spend at the souvenir shop. Not only the remorseful trip seemed to be the usual outing when the bus stopped near the stadium.
I ran out first. I watched the clouds above the stadium and nodded my head knowing that there would be no better day for this. We went through all the rooms and even entered the terrain on which all the greats themselves ran. I had the urge to bend out and feel the grass barefoot with my feet, breathing in so deeply the scents of jerseys, sweat and blood from injuries during matches.
Everything went too fast, I didn't even arrive after the museum to spend all the money in the souvenir shop when the road manager said we had to get on the bus. Too soon, the thing that interested me most was passing.
